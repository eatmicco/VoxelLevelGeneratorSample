# VoxelLevelGeneratorSample

This is a sample code for voxel level generator. To handle large level, I used regions per mesh. 
I think it is quite sufficient for big voxel game.
To generate noise I just use Unity's Perlin Noise function.
This code still has a lot room to improve, and I will try improve it in the future.
